## Front-End Development
Front-end or client-side development is a relatively obscure Internet discipline. 
Historically, this role has been known under several aliases, htmler, web 
designer, coder, frontender and so on, but its core functions remain the same 
while expanding with the progress of the Internet. It is a hinge role that 
requires both aesthetic sensitivity and programmatic rigor.

To many people, client-side development might be perceived as 'making things 
pretty' and, while it is a valid comment since we do make things look good, as 
good-looking things sell better, there are many other technologies that fall 
within this field that might be usually overlooked.

The front-end of a web page is made of three things:  
1. Structured content (HTML)  
2. Presentation (CSS)  
3. Interaction/behaviour (JavaScript)  

* **Frameworks**
  * Angular
  * Backbone
  * etc.

* **Libraries**
  * jQuery
  * YUI
  * etc.
