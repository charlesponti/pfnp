## What is Programming?
A program is essentially a set of instructions, similar to a recipe, given to a
machine, whether it be a computer or any other device, to execute in order to
accomplish a task or provide a service.

## What Do Programs Actually Do?
* Keeping track of values (Variables)
* Making decisions (if -> else)
* Repeating things (loops)
* Displaying things (templating and style languages)
* Logging things (Log Files)
* Storing things (Databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB)

## What Can You Build?
* Web Sites
* Web Applications
* Native Apps (Mobile and Desktop)
* etc.

## Project Processes:

### Waterfall
![Waterfall Development Model](http://www.learnaccessvba.com/images/application_development/Waterfall_model.png)

Does one stage of the development process at a time, never to go back and repeat a previous step

### Agile
![Agile Development Model](http://www.tplex.com/images/tplex/AgileDevelopment.png)

Allows developers to jump from one stage to another and back again depending on what is needed to complete the job.

## Stages of Web Development

### 1. Design

### 2. Development

Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding.

#### How are users accessing your site?
* desktop or mobile?
* phone or tablet?
* internationalization
* user disabilities

### 3. Testing

> "As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. It was on one of my journeys between the EDSAC room and the punching equipment that 'hesitating at the angles of stairs' the realisation came over me with full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent finding errors in my own programs." - Maurice Wilkes

Web applications undergo the same unit, integration and system testing as traditional desktop applications. But because web application clients vary so greatly, teams might perform some additional testing, such as:

* Security
* Performance, Load, and Stress
* HTML/CSS validation
* Accessibility
* Usability
* Cross-browser

Many types of tests are automatable. At the component level, one of the xUnit packages can be a helpful tool. Or an organization can create its own unit testing framework. At the GUI level, Watir or iMacros are useful.

## Programming Languages

### What to look for in a language
* Community support
* Stack Overflow
* Difficulty level
* Development time
* Is what you want to accomplish going to happen on the front-end or the back-end?

## Frameworks & Libraries

A web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources. The framework aims to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks and session management, and they often promote code reuse.

## APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

In addition to accessing databases or computer hardware, such as hard disk drives or video cards, an API can be used to ease the work of programming graphical user interface components. In practice, many times an API comes in the form of a library that includes specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, and variables. In some other cases, notably for SOAP and REST services, an API comes as just a specification of remote calls exposed to the API consumers

## Version Control
Handles the management of changes to documents. It allows developers to manage multiple versions of the same codebase, which comes in handy when bugs get accidently introduced and the application needs to be reverted to a previous working state.

* **What Does Version Control Help Developers Do?**
	* Keeps track of the version of code
	* Helps developers collaborate with each other
	* Keeps track of who contributed
	* Open-source (release code to the world for free!)
	* **Popular Tools**
		* GitHub
		* BitBucket
	* **Version Control Systems:**
		* Git
		* Bazaar
		* Subversion
		* Mercurial

## Tools


* **Codepen.io** A "sandbox" for creating and editing HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

* **Sublime Text** Text editor with added funtionality for programming.

* **Browser Developer Tools**
	* Examples: Firebug(Firefox) & Google Developer Tools(Chrome)
	* allow developers to debug and test ideas directly in the browser
	* usually provide a JavaScript console for debugging
	* show the HTML, CSS, and JS files that makes up the webpage
	* 3D view of webpage (FireFox)

## Best Practices
* **D.R.Y** - Don't Repeat Yourself
* **Commenting**
* **Testing**
* **Seperation of Concerns** - Keep your templating, styling, and behaviours seperated
